# Figures

This folder contains **publication‑ready figures** generated programmatically from analysis results.

## Principles
- Never create figures manually in Excel/PowerPoint
- Figures should be reproducible by re‑running code
- Filenames should match manuscript figure numbers

## Recommended workflow
1. Run analysis scripts in `../analysis/`
2. Generate figures using scripts in this folder
3. Save figures here as `.png` or `.pdf`

Example naming:
- `Fig1_KM_TACE_vs_TARE.png`
- `Fig2_Logistic_ORs.pdf`
